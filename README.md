# Pizza-Shop-Management-Web-API
 Create a RESTful web API that allows users to manage pizza data in a database. The API should support the following operations:  

1.Retrieve a list of all pizzas 

2.Retrieve a specific pizza by ID  

3.Add a new pizza 

4.Update an existing pizza by ID  

5.Delete a pizza by ID

-> ID (integer, primary key)  

-> Name (string)  

-> Toppings (string) 

-> Category (string) 

-> Size (string) 

-> Price (int) 

 
Technical Requirements:  

  
-> Use ASP.NET Web API to implement the RESTful API.  

-> Use ADO.NET to interact with the database.  

-> Use HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs to implement the corresponding operations.  

-> Use JSON as the data format for input and output.  

-> Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of each operation.  

-> Handle errors and exceptions gracefully.  

-> Implement input validation to ensure that data is well-formed and within reasonable limits.  

-> Implement proper security measures, such as authentication and authorization, to protect the API from unauthorized access.
